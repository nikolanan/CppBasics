The program determines whether a toy shop owner can go on a vacation.
He gets an extensive order to fulfil. He wants to go on an excursion with the money that will be earned.
Prices for the ordered toys are the following: puzzle - 2.60, talking doll - 3, fluffy bear - 4.10, minion - 8.20, toy truck - 2.
If the ordered toys are 50 or more, the store offers a discount of 25% of the total price. From the money earned, the owner has to give 10% for the rent of the shop.
To calculate whether the money will be enough for him to go on an excursion.

The input is in the following order: 1. Price of the excursion, 2. Number of puzzles, 3. Number of talking dolls, 4. Number of fluffy bears, 5. Number of minions
