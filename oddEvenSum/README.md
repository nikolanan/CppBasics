The program reads n-th number of integers entered by the user and checks whether the sum of the numbers in even positions is equal to the sum of the numbers in odd positions.
If the sums are equal the output must be: "Yes" /n "Sum = 70", otherwise "No" /n "Diff = 1" (the difference is an absolute value).

Sample input: 4 10 50 60 20

Sample output:

Yes

Sum = 70
