A program that reads 2 * n-th number of integers entered by the user and checks whether the sum of the first n numbers (left sum) is equal to the sum of the second n numbers (right sum).
If there is a tie, print " Yes, sum = " + the sum; otherwise it prints " No, diff = " + the difference.
The difference is calculated as a positive number.

Sample input: 2 10 90 60 40

Sample output: Yes, sum = 100
