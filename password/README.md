Firstly, the program reads a username and a password. 
After that, if a correct password is entered the message - "Welcome {username}!" appears otherwise the program requires a new attempt to guess the password. 
The process continues until the correct password is entered.

Sample input: User qwerty 12345 1232 1234 password qwerty

Sample output: Welcome User!
